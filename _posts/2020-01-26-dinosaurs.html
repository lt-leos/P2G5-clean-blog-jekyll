<p>Howdy! I'm Diego, a Technology Management senior and person who is responsible for way too many things this year. I at least try my best. I'm minoring in both cybersecurity and business, have some work experience in those fields, and am always looking to gain more experience or bragging rights wherever I can.</p>

<p>You may ask: "What are some of the things you deeply regret being involved with due to all the newfound responsibilites?"</p>

<p>I got a little too eager this year with the following involvements:</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Clubs and Activities</h2>

<p>This year, I am the president of the Texas A&M SCUBA club, and probably one of two officers that actually does anything along with my logistics coordinator. Despite being relatively new to scuba, being only certified since last October, I quickly scooped up more advanced certifications for the fun of it and to learn critical diving skills. Hearing repeatedly from the dive shop owner about how the club was poorly ran, along with only a single dive taking place in the spring semester, I decided to run which ended up being unopposed. Now I do my absolute best to revitalize, streamline, and improve the club however I can to make it more appealing to all students.</p>

<p>In addition, I'm also the social media and recruitment officer for the Aggie Barbeque Club. That one was more accidental, since I just take good pictures and thought it would be fun to take it more seriously. I'm technically also one of the pitmasters, since all the officers are responsible for cooking, so that's usually fun if not tasty.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Work</h2>

<p>I also have a job which I've had to neglect for a bit due to being overly busy. I am a security analyst for the university, working in the basement of the Teague building to hunt and evaluate threats on A&M's systems. Usually there's not much, but on occassion we find interesting stuff. I'm hoping I can go into cyber forensics in the future, likely working for the federal government, which I am very greatful that this job gives me the opportunity to learn in such a niche field thanks to my boss's position. I learned quickly that other IT fields like endpoint weren't for me after my internship this summer with General Dynamics, which I hoenstly hated.</p>

<p>I do love visiting job fairs at least, but I fear that one day I will have to beg recruiters for a good job.</p>
